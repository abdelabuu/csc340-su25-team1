## About Me
Hi! I'm currently taking CSC 340 and working on improving my understanding of Git, version control, and team-based development. Iâ€™m excited to get more hands-on coding experience this semester.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to get comfortable using GitHub, collaborate on group projects more effectively, and grow my confidence in writing clean, efficient code.
